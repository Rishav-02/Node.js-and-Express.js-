Streaming can be done by both stream module and Http module.

A Node.js stream can help process large files, larger than the free memory of your computer, since it processes the data in small chunks.

The big advantage of streams is that you can process large files (bigger than the available memory). In general, reading a large file into memory is an inefficient use of resources.
