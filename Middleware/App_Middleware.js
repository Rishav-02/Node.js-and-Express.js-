//Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. These functions are used to modify req and res objects for tasks like parsing request bodies, adding response headers, etc.

/* Advantages of using middleware:

1.Middleware can process request objects multiple times before the server works for that request.
2.Middleware can be used to add logging and authentication functionality.
3.Middleware improves client-side rendering performance.
4.Middleware is used for setting some specific HTTP headers.
5.Middleware helps for Optimization and better performance. */

//Syntax:-  app.use(path, callback)
/* path: It is the path for which the middleware function is being called. It can be a string representing a path or path pattern or regular expression pattern to match the paths.  

callback: It is a middleware function or a series/array of middleware functions. */
