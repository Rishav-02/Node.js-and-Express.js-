//Routing defines the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints.
// OR in other word -  Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

//There is a special routing method, app.all(), used to load middleware functions at a path for all HTTP request methods. For example,using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

const express = require("express");
const app = express(); //app is object

/*
res.download()	 Prompt a file to be downloaded.
res.end()	 End the response process.
res.json()	 Send a JSON response.
res.jsonp()	 Send a JSON response with JSONP support.
res.redirect()	 Redirect a request.
res.render()	 Render a view template.
res.send()	     Send a response of various types.
res.sendFile()	 Send a file as an octet stream.
res.sendStatus()	Set the response status code  and send its string representation as the response body. */
