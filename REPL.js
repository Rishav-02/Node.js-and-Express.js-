/* REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment like a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell where a command is entered and the system responds with an output in an interactive mode. Node.js or Node comes bundled with a REPL environment. It performs the following tasks −

Read − Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.

Eval − Takes and evaluates the data structure.

Print − Prints the result.

Loop − Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl+c twice or ctrl+d once.

The REPL feature of Node is very useful in experimenting with Node.js codes and to debug JavaScript codes. */


//REPL use:
// js Expression
// use variables
// Multiline code / loops
// use underscore( _ ) to get the last result
// we can use editor mode by type ".editor" then you enter in editor mode.

/* When we call a function the value we pass is called Argument.
When we define a function the value which we will pass is called Parameter. */

//type node in terminal then REPL starts sign is ">"  press Tab key 2 time to show all modules of Nodejs and press any module name to see all function exist in that module.

//write node then enter

/* $ node
> x = 10
10
> var y = 10
undefined
> x + y
20
> console.log("Hello World")
Hello World
undefined */ 
//These are some examples of REPL

console.log("Rishav Sinha");
